# lid-driven-cavity-flow

Lid-driven cavity flow is a well known problem in the field of fluid dynamics. It is commonly used as a benchmark problem to verify new simulation methods for incompressible viscous flows.

The problem can be described as follows; consider the two-dimensional domain depicted in the image above, we have a closed cavity with side lengths l<sub>x</sub>=l<sub>y</sub>= 1. The top wall (the lid) is moving in the positive x-direction with a constant unit velocity (V<sub>x</sub>). The other three walls are stationary, and the velocities in the y-direction (V<sub>y</sub>) are zero for all the walls. The cavity is filled with an incompressible, viscous fluid in which a flow is induced by the moving lid.
